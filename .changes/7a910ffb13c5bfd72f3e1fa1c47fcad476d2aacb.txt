Overall
### Overall Intent & Scope
Update the `employee_management.py` module to include additional features for handling employee leave requests.

- **file name:** `employee_management.py`
- **code changes:**
  - Added a new function, `handle_leave_request`, to process and validate leave requests.
  - Enhanced existing functions like `process_employee_payslip` to account for leave days.
  - Introduced a configuration file, `leave_config.json`, to manage leave policies.

- **Modules/services impacted:** 
  - Employee Management (Core)

- **Risk & Rollout Notes:**
  - Introducing new functionality may impact the current system stability. A rollback plan has been outlined in case of any unforeseen issues.
  - The update will be deployed in stages, with a gradual roll-out to minimize disruptions.

- **Follow-ups:**
  - Conduct unit tests for `handle_leave_request` and ensure they cover all edge cases.
  - Update the documentation on `employee_management.py` to reflect these changes.
  - Notify HR operations about the new leave request handling process.
